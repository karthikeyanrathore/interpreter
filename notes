- Code Genearation (convert program to asssembly lang or bytes or ...)


Lexical Analysis
- divides program into tokens.

Parsing
- tree
- structuring

Semantic Analysis 
- Hard
- lang create strict rules to remove ambiguity.
- x = y * 0 then x = 0 (this is true only for int)
- if x & y are floating points then x = NaN by ieee.

Optimiztion
- space 
- speed

Code Genearation
